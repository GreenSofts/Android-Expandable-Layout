# Android ExpandableLayout

##This is a practice project of [ExpandableLayout Library] (https://github.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout)

We'll design this type of sample Android App with Expandable Layout Feature.

All data will come from [this API] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasancse91/Android-Expandable-Layout/master/RelatedFiles/data.json) in JSON format.

I used here:
- CardVeiw
- RecyclerView
- Retrofit for network call
- Picasso for image loading
- [ExpandableLayout Library] (https://github.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout) for Expand expected view
